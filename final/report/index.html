            <h1>Final Project Report</h1>
            <h3>User Testing: <a href="../../studio3">Game On!</a></h3>
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users found several mechanics of the game confusing and
                    would benefit from more guidance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some UI choices led to certain text or other aspects of the
                    game being hidden.
                </li>
                <li>The story / narrative could be developed more.</li>
                <li>Users wanted a clear ending to the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Participants</h2>
            <p>Two users, Erica and Ivy, were asked to play the game.</p>
            <p>
                Both are 21-year-old students with some gaming experience. They
                played the game on their laptops, and both are
                upper-middle-income background with some college education.
            </p>

            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <p>
                Participants were asked to play the game until either they
                reached a conclusion or they were bored. Participants were not
                given help or communication. One participant lost the game early
                on while the other defeated all the stages.

            <h2>Results - Bugs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game would freeze if all allies were defeated.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="bug.png" />
            <h2>Results - Usability Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users found certain aspects of the game, such as the action
                    bar, confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One participant didnâ€™t realize there were more action
                    options because part of their screen was cut off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using enter to submit the name input would be intuitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One user wasn't aware that the moves could be hovered over
                    for a description.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Results - Other Feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The lack of a win or loss screen was confusing.</li>
                <li>
                    Users were not sure what the story/narrative was and hoped
                    it could make more sense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participants found it weird there could be more than one of
                    the same character.
                </li>
            </ul>
