            <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
            <p>
                I plan on updating the Game On project by updating its visual
                design, and by developing its functionality to have a more
                enjoyable gameplay&nbsp;experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of visual updates, a lot more can be done with CSS
                animations and I want to incorporate more of that into the
                project. I also want to try drawing more things to put into the
                game. In terms of gameplay, I want to both balance out the
                difficulty throughout the game and add progression elements,
                such as a shop from which the player can choose upgrades in
                between rounds. I also want to explore more interactive ways to
                execute attacks (like playing a brief minigame to
                determine&nbsp;success).
            </p>
            <p>
                I would love to have feedback from both players who are
                experienced in the turn-based RPG genre and from users who might
                be unfamiliar. For the visuals I should also get feedback
                from&nbsp;designers.
