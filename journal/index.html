                    made me uncomfortable because it showed the thought process
                    of a profit maximalist - e.g. design with the objective of
                    maximizing revenue rather than accomplishing user good. For
                    instance, almost every bit of design research Dori has done
                    is framed in how it can improve monetization or retaining
                    attention. Store menus are set up to make buying things more
                    convenient than backing out; menus are laid out to force
                    users to accidentally click on advertising, using UX tricks
                    to skirt around usability rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, despite all of the posturing about "making
                    the world a better place," this seems to be the norm for
                    modern UI / UX design, something which has turned me off of
                    the field completely. Modern designers aren't taught how to
                    solve important problems, they're taught how to manipulate
                    users into achieving goals that further the capital of the
                    corporations they work for, even if this work is harmful to
                    consumers, children, or human rights. Even student-run clubs
                    like Design Interactive or DCC are setup to place frankly
                    evil companies like Amazon or big oil on pedestals,
                    advocating for personal career success or wealth at all
                    costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really hope we can change the narrative of the design
                    field to place ethical responsibility of our design choices
                    back in the center, instead of giving platforms to designers
                    like Dori.

                        href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"

                    about using images to facilitate interest and closer reading
                    among students really resonated with me as I have also
                    experienced the difficulty of being forced to read or
                    analyze subjects I am not interested in. At the same time,
                    there is simply so much content out there that it is
                    difficult to even identify what is worth reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think images can be highly helpful in bridging this gap as
                    they can catch attention and inspire audiences to look
                    closer without wasting their time. Especially when combined
                    with interactive sites or displays, they can be a great
                    tool. Learning how to more closely analyze images and ask
                    questions as described in the article is a vital skill not
                    just to our own research but also to make considerations
                    when designing websites with images.

                    I recently came across
                    <a href="https://mollysoda.exposed/">this website</a> which
                    I really loved. The use images and visuals in a very bold
                    intriguing way that kind of forces you to read in deeper.

                <h3>overlays design pattern research</h3>
                <p>
                    I read "Overuse of Overlays" by the Nielson Norman Group
                    which expanded on some common problems with overlay misuse.
                    The basic premise is that designers need to be more
                    thoughtful about how they incorporate overlays, asking
                    themselves "Who", "What", "When", "Where", and "Why?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, a user should fully understand how to
                    interface with the overlay and its presence should not be
                    disruptive to their goals. Overlays that intrude on the
                    browsing experience unprompted, or whose controls are
                    ambiguous or confusing, create negative experiences. Another
                    consideration is that overlays must be built to work
                    properly on all screen sizes and be vetted for bugs so that
                    they don't completely wall off the entire use of the
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be sure to consider these points the next time I
                    think about incorporating an overlay!

                <h3>research on form design</h3>
                <p>
                    Forms are important but can also be some of the most
                    frustrating parts of a web experience, especially since
                    nearly every form is built differently. In order to make a
                    form as accessible and effective as possible, it should
                    follow some rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduce the amount of inputs</li>
                    <li>use basic top-down one-column hierarchy</li>
                    <li>
                        split the form into multiple steps to prevent
                        overwhelming the user
                    </li>
                    <li>use intuitive labels and indicate required fields</li>
                    <li>explain formatting requirements</li>
                    <li>reduce clicks and other friction</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One example of a website which I think has very intuitive
                    forms is the
                    <a href="https://getcalfresh.org">getCalFresh website</a>.
                    The design of the form makes it so much easier for people in
                    need to submit their information for aid. In addition to
                    having an effective UI, it only asks a few questions at a
                    time, evaluating what information and what questions to ask
                    next to reduce unnecessary steps and make things as simple
                    as possible.
