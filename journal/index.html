            <h3>research on form design</h3>
            <p>
                Forms are important but can also be some of the most frustrating parts of a web experience, especially
                since nearly every form is built differently.
                In order to make a form as accessible and effective as possible, it should follow some rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>reduce the amount of inputs</li>
                <li>use basic top-down one-column hierarchy</li>
                <li>split the form into multiple steps to prevent overwhelming the user</li>
                <li>use intuitive labels and indicate required fields</li>
                <li>explain formatting requirements</li>
                <li>reduce clicks and other friction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                One example of a website which I think has very intuitive forms is the <a
                    href="https://getcalfresh.org">getCalFresh website</a>. The design of the form
                makes it so much easier for people in need to submit their information for aid. In addition to
                having an effective UI, it only asks a few questions at a time, evaluating what information and what
                questions to ask next to reduce unnecessary steps and make things as simple as possible.
